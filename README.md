# ASCII-filter

---

Thanks to the Computer Graphics courses during my studies, I became interested in the topic of image processing. After completing the courses, I wanted to test image processing methods in JavaScript using live camera input. So, I created this project and named it "ASCII-filter," as the initial idea was to convert the camera image into ASCII characters. However, I later added more filters and various parameters that users can dynamically adjust, such as gamma parameter or square size (pixel size). I incorporated animations into the application, as it was also a topic I've been wanting to delve into for a while.

##### Technologies I used:
