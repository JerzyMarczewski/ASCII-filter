# ASCII-filter

---

Thanks to the Computer Graphics courses during my studies, I became interested in the topic of image processing. After completing the courses, I wanted to test image processing methods in JavaScript using live camera input. So, I created this project, named ASCII-filter, as the initial idea was to convert the camera image into a dynamic ASCII character grid. I later added more filters and various parameters that users can dynamically adjust, such as the gamma parameter or square size (pixel size). I implemented all filtration techniques myself and designed the user interface in Figma. Additionally, I incorporated more advanced animations into the application, as it was also a topic I've been wanting to delve into for a while.

##### Technologies I used:

- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- React
- react-transition-group
- Redux
- TypeScript
